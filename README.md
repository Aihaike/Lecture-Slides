Issue Tracking for the Lecture Slides
=====================================

Please file a new [Issue](https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Lecture-Slides/issues) if you have found any bugs or have any comments about the lecture slides.

PowerPoint slides don't behave well in git and so this respository doesn't contain the slides themselves, except for the specific versions we release (find these as under "releases").
